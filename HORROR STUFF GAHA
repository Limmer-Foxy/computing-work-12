i dont know why i looked up, but when i did, i saw her.
the thing that has been keeping me awake almost every night, appearing in every dream since the day i visited my dead grandmother.
the face covered in blood, yet with a cartoon-like smile, with crooked yellow teeth, with a smell that would make me puke my gut out
i stood there, speechless. this had never happened to me and i did not know what to do.
regaining my contiousness i ran to my daughters room. 
horrified i heard screaming coming from her room
no, this could not be.
i ran towards the door and started trying to banging on the door in attempt to open it.

my daughter, carrying almost the same smile as that thing had on its face, saying in the most disturbing face i had ever heard
"mommy, its fine, annabelle just wanted to play!"
shook, i ran back downstairs only to find the window shattered on the floor. 
she was gone. till nw, i have no idea what had happened to my daughter or whatever that thing had intended to do with her,
